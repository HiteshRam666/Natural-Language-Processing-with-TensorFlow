# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets üå™Ô∏èüå®Ô∏è

## Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not

### Introduction on NLP

 Have you ever imagined how mails are classified into spam and ham or how the tweets are classified into good or bad?.. All these are happened because of the advancement in the field of NLP or Natural Language Processing. With the help of NLP several models are created for accomplishing many tasks like spam classifier mobile, chatbots, recommendation systems etc. NLP is now one of fastest growing field and several companies are invested in this for acquiring valuable insights.

In todays article we are going to discuss about the analysis and creation of a disaster tweet classification. After this article you will get familiar with the text preprocessing concepts and LSTM model creation.

So let‚Äôs understand dataset.

## Dataset 

The dataset we‚Äôre used here is Disaster tweet data. It contains 5 columns out of which we only concerned about ‚Äútext‚Äù column that contains the tweet data and ‚Äútarget‚Äù column that show whether the given tweet is disaster or not. We need to perform some text preprocessing techniques tweet data for getting good results.

## What is NLP used for?
Natural Language Processing is the driving force behind the following common applications:

- Language translation applications such as Google Translate
- Word Processors such as Microsoft Word and Grammarly that employ NLP to check grammatical accuracy of texts.
- Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications used in call centers to respond to certain users‚Äô requests.
- Personal assistant applications such as OK Google, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa.
